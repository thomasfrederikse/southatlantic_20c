## Directory `Data`

### GRD_rsl_uniform.grd:
netCDF file with uniform realtive sea-level fingerprints for Greenland, West- and East-Antarctica and glaciers. All fingerprints are normalized to a unit barystatic contribution. Multiple free software packages is available to view and modify NetCDF files. For example [python](https://unidata.github.io/netcdf4-python/), [Julia](https://github.com/Alexander-Barth/NCDatasets.jl), [GMT](https://www.generic-mapping-tools.org/), [ncview](http://meteora.ucsd.edu/~pierce/ncview_home_page.html), and many others. 

### steric_trends_1957_2018.nc:
netCDF file with linear trends over 1957-2018 in steric sea level from various data sets. All units are mm. Please properly cite the underlying data source, see the metadata of the netCDF file and/or the manuscript.  Multiple free software packages is available to view and modify NetCDF files. For example [python](https://unidata.github.io/netcdf4-python/), [Julia](https://github.com/Alexander-Barth/NCDatasets.jl), [GMT](https://www.generic-mapping-tools.org/), [ncview](http://meteora.ucsd.edu/~pierce/ncview_home_page.html), and many others. 

### Swan_inlet_sl_data.txt
Text file with the sea-level index points from the Swan Inlet salt marsh. Please cite Newton, T. L., Gehrels, W. R., Fyfe, R. M., & Daley, T. J. (2020).
